>>> Regex to match semantic versioning

Here's a regular expression that matches a semantic version string:
```
^[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}(?:-(?:alpha|beta|rc)\.[0-9]+)?$
```
Explanation of the regex:

* `^` asserts position at start of a line
* `[0-9]{1,3}` matches any number between 0 and 3 digits long (i.e., major version)
* `\.` matches a dot character
* `[0-9]{1,3}` matches any number between 0 and 3 digits long (i.e., minor version)
* `\.` matches a dot character
* `[0-9]{1,3}` matches any number between 0 and 3 digits long (i.e., patch version)
* `(?:-(?:alpha|beta|rc)\.[0-9]+)?` is an optional non-capturing group that matches one of the following:
	+ `-` followed by either "alpha", "beta" or "rc", followed by a dot character, followed by any number of digits (i.e., pre-re

pre-release version)
* `$` asserts position at end of a line

This regular expression will match strings that follow the semantic versioning format, which consists of three numbers 
separated by dots and an optional pre-release identifier. The pre-release identifier is made up of a hyphen followed by one of 
"alpha", "beta" or "rc" followed by a dot^[ character and any number of digits.
